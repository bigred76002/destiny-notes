# Anomaly Clan Vow of the Disciple Walkthrough

Brought to you by bigred76, cpTylor, and Tr1d3nT.


This walkthrough is meant as general advice, feel free to reach out for edits. Substitute supers/roles/weapons as you feel works best for your specific fireteam. There really is not a one size fits all for this, just use what works best for you if this isn't it. Make sure for boss DPS phases your fireteam agrees on one strategy. Having multiple strategies reduces DPS output therefore your chances for success. Be open to trying things, this is your sandbox. Get a little dirty and have some fun!

Image references for the encounters are after their respective sections. Major props to the ones that have created these for the Destiny 2 community.

## Entrance Encounter

Loadout:
* General add clear. Whatever supers, doesn't really matter.

Encounter: 
* Kill sus Savathun, the adds will despawn
* Sparrow down the path until you reach the Bus and take a ride.
* Clear adds and the three Abominations at each stop, then pick up the gold beacons. These will give you the Knowledge buff and you can take up to three stacks. Bring them back to the Bus to deposit.
* The Abominations' existence adds to your Darkness buff and if it hits 10 you're dead. You can clear these stacks with proximity to the bus for a short period of time or killing all of the Abominations in the area. Make sure that you are cleared before running off again if the Abominations are still alive.
 
**First secret chest is in this section.** You will need to shoot three Nuts on the way. They show up on your HUD with an icon like a planetary material when you're close.The first Nut is in a small cove to the left of the boat’s second stop. It is in the corner. The second Nut is at the bus's third stop. Using the bus's stopped position as a guide, head in a 10 o’clock direction from the front of the surfboard. This Nut will be just ahead to your left. The third Nut is found under the bridge at the bus's fourth stop. You will find it hidden in the right corner and you can shoot it through the rails or from the other side one arch is missing bars where you can enter. The chest is located inside the building ahead of this on the right. Make sure to clear the adds and NOT pick up all the Wisdom buffs so the bus stays with you.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** 
* BEFORE DROPPING DOWN INSIDE THE PYRAMID! Check the totem in the middle of the big room. This has three symbols inside the three "secret" rooms you need to activate the wall plates in. The plate guide is at the end of this guide. You only need to activate the three shown, but if you forget what they are you CAN do all of them and still qualify for the extra chest at the final boss. To our understanding these must all be done on the same run, does not count off of a CP.
* Dropping down once you're inside the pyramid is rough. Bring a sword. Hunters can dive from the top. Otherwise, you WILL break your legs (and lose a potential flawless run). Titans can use heavy on Crown, just jump out and smash away. 

## First Encounter: Acquisition

### Loadout
Unstoppable, add clear, burst damage heavy like Gally or sword. No preference to super, add clear and stay alive; no boss.

### Encounter

* Three sets of two teams: defender and seeker
* Arena is divided into two sides: Right side is dark, left side is light

* Three symbols on totem:
     * Top is side where taken knight spawns, kill ASAP
     * After the knight is dead the second symbol shows the room to go to. 
     * Seeker goes to room and the third (bottom) symbol spawns. Defender calls out light or dark from the bottom symbol on the totem.
     * Seeker kills Glyphkeeper (chieftain with solar shield) on the side that matches the third symbol (light/dark). Once the Glyphkeeper dies, champs will spawn near defenders. 
     * Seeker then sees a new symbol will spawn where this chieftain died. Calls out and someone in the fireteam notates the call out. 

* Each team does this, once per totem. Defender will say "Room is xxxx with xxxx side", seeker will call back "Room has XXXXX symbol"
* You are on a timer, this resets when the correct Glyphkeeper is killed inside each room.
* Once all 3 totems are done with their symbols and call outs, the obelisks near the totems will display 9 symbols each. Only one obelisk will have all three symbols. 
* Group up with two players per obelisk, look for the three symbols collected by the seekers. Once you identify the obelisk with all three, shoot the correct symbols at the same time, within about a half a second of each other. 
* If you're not fast enough, you'll see an animation on the obelisks wiping the symbols and redrawing them. Resume looking for the three symbols. You will have three chances. If you don't do it correctly by the third time, the team wipes. Each Obelisk will have all three symbols only ONCE during this encounter. After you clear a phase make sure to rule that Obelisk out and focus on the remaining ones that haven't had all three symbols yet.

Rinse and repeat three times.

## Second Encounter -- Caretaker:

* Three sets of two: add clear, runners, distractors

### Loadout  
* Preference goes to autoloading perked on one. Preferences are: Sleeper/Cartesian, Reeds/Arby, Izzy/RL, Izzy/Linear, Witherhoard/Linear, Witherhoard/RL AND add clear AR/SMG that uses primary ammo AND Outbreak with catalyst for when out of special on character to swap to. Special finisher only goes so far!

* Banner Titan, Well Lock, and burst damage supers. Moebius Quiver is a good option for hunters. If you are not running a Banner Shield, pick someone on your team, they’re the honorary Banner Shield for this encounter. We Titans will allow it as long as they are fond of purple crayons.

* Moebius Quiver will override Div however they both have the same debuff level so it doesn't matter. Moebius Quiver will add damage as well as save Div ammo so it can be a viable strategy.

* Div is preferred on Well-Lock so damage supers get 30% buff. If Banner Shield Titan uses it, Div will not be operating for a long time. If others use it, supers won't take advantage of Div..
### Encounter

#### Add Clear
* Splits and clears each side from centerline to wall. Do not forget the walkways! Runners and Distractors are to call out as needed for help, keep an ear open and comms clear. 

* Scorn are highest priority. Second highest priority are enemies in the middle. Enemies and worm rockets from the Caretaker will shorten Runner's timer, eliminate them as rapidly as possible.


* If you hear distractors calling for help ("shoot head"/"shoot back"), look at the Caretaker and shoot its glowing yellow area. Read below to understand why.

#### Runners
* You will be going into the room and collecting the Knowledge buff and shooting the Obelisk to clear the symbols.
     * Open doors by shooting/damaging one of the nuts in the center. 
     * One runner at a time, go into the room and look for knowledge buffs (yellow-glowing symbols), up to three buffs per entrance.
     * Call out the symbols as you collect them. Remember what symbols you collected as well. Doing both ensures that the person on the outside can assist quicker while shooting the symbols. 
     * While searching for buffs, dodge witches and adds inside, they will wreck you. You gain a Pervasive Darkness buff inside the room. 
       * **Preference survival over quantity of buffs.** 
     * Go back outside. 
     * If locked in the room, call out and the other Runner will open the door for you by shooting the nut (avoid running into the door if it's been a long time, the door may kill you as it closes). 
     * Once a Runner exits with the collected buffs, wait for a text "Obelisk is ready for XXXXX's offer" (XXXX = player's name) and look for the symbols on the Obelisk that correspond to the ones they collected inside the room. 
     * Runner that just came out of the room with buffs counts down and both Runners shoot at the symbols. Remember: symbols must be shot quickly, half second or so max of wiggle room. The outside Runner can use the call outs from the inside Runner to start looking for the symbols. 
     * If helpful, ask Add Clearers to shoot a symbol too (e.g. if they are in 3 different faces). 
     * Once this is done, Runners swap roles: the one who waited goes inside the room, while the first runner loses their Darkness debuff. 

**This cannot be said enough:** 
* Do not hesitate to leave darkness to live over grabbing max Knowledge of three. Alive and depositing is better than dead and none! You can easily grab three in the first room but safe play is two unless Runners feel confident. 
* Runners are advised to follow clockwise rotation on the room, so the next Runner doesn't look for symbols where the previous Runner already collected. Call out which side you are grabbing and try to grab symbols further away first or only on one side to make final grabs easier. 


* For exotics it is an option: Warlocks can put on Transversive Steps, Titans their Lion Rampants or Dunemarchers, and Hunters their Stomp33s to expedite the retrieval process. You can swap back to another exotic for DPS, there's plenty of time. It's not needed but if you are finding yourself slower than you need to be these are viable options.

* There are big jumps and gaps inside the upper floors. Third room has buffs directly above doors, leave them for last.



#### Distractors
* Slow down the Caretaker by keeping him busy and stunning him. 
     * One Distractor takes a position on each side of him, front and back. 
     * Dart in close and out quickly to get him to trigger his stomp mechanic. His head will glow orange to show that you have successfully triggered the stomp. 
     * To initiate the stun, shoot his head quickly using a fast primary SMG or AR. Glaives (and most specials) will one-shot it. 
       * You can shoot the Caretaker's head as he raises his hands and he'll not have a chance to stomp you (easy to do while sliding). 
     * Person behind shoots inside the backpack when it is open. 
       * Best practice for the Distractor behind him is to start shooting while the Distractor in front of him is shooting the head so as to proc stun immediately. 

* If the Caretaker reaches the obelisk too early (see below), the team wipes. So the goal is to repeat this stun mechanic as often as possible. 

* Everyone helps as needed, if Distractors call for someone to shoot head/back, every able fireteam member should turn and shoot ASAP.



#### Damage Phases 
* Once all symbols are entered by the Runners, the damage phase will start. 

* Around the obelisk there are three gray plates. 
     * When you stand on this plate it will have a haze to it indicating the DPS phase for that plate has started. 
     * Shoot the Caretaker from that place. 
     * Usually the first plate to glow will be on the same side the Caretaker walked up. Then it rotates to the middle, and then to the last plate. 
     * When the plate is about to expire and you need to move to the next, a text will appear warning you it's about to expire. 
     * Banner Shield will then call out to go on to the next plate. 


**Remember:** 
* Banner Shield calls when to step on and when to step off to the next plate. This designated player calling out minimizes getting on the plate and shortening your short DPS window, maximizing the chances for success!


* After the timer of the last plate ends or you reach the damage gate from the boss, the damage phase ends. 
* Stairs will come down to let you up to the next level. 
* You will repeat this same mechanic for two more levels (three in total). The higher the level, the larger the room and the path of the Caretaker. Adds spawn more frequently as well. 

* Be mindful that a fall here can end a run quickly and try your best. If you fall, attempt to run back up. It's possible but you have to be quick.

* After you're done with the third level, stairs will appear in the center and you'll have a Final Stand with a timer. You'll have three plates again and the boss will simply stay in front of you shooting flying worms. Do your best with the remaining of the ammo you have. Survivability here is key. 

* Well-Lock should try using Blessings whenever possible (better than rifts only) or Fusion Grenades.

* A good option is to swap to Outbreak Perfected with catalyst or whatever you have that's primary ammo for weapons you have no ammunition for. You will most likely not have any special or heavy ammo left by this point, just unload absolutely everything you have and hit him hard!

## Jumping puzzle
### Loadout
* Your favorite jumping boots and something with arc/add clear. 
     * Swords are recommended for those that like them for jumping.
     * For Warlocks it is recommended to switch to Strafe Glide for better handling as some jumps go around corners.
 
### Encounter
* Jump. 
* Don't fall. 
* Shoot the Nuts to swap platforms that are showing. 
* Two people are needed at each Nut due to adds that will spawn occassionally. 
* Halfway through the jumping area and after you go to the second room with adds and a nut to shoot, platforms appear that lead to a secret chest opposite of the direction you need to go. 
     * The person that went to the second room can backtrack and go to the other side. 
* Everyone else should hold up for the platforms to stabilize. 
* In the secret chest room there is a drop down to the second nut/add room.
* More jumps! 
* At the spinning rods someone has to quickly jump through and reach the next area. 
     * One player will need to actuate the nut to keep the spinning rods going. 
     * Each time you activate it they will reverse the direction of the rods. 
     * If you do not actuate the Nut then they will go into the walls and your jumper will fall. 
* Once the jumper makes it back on solid ground and up on top at the other side, they stabilize and stop moving on the left and right sides. 
* Jump back and forth like a zipper.



## Third Encounter -- Artifacts

### Loadout
* Overload champs. Add clears. No bosses to beat so survival/add clear supers are good to go. You might want something long range in case a Hobgoblin is a long way off.

### Encounter

#### First Room
* One Relic to start with: Resonant Shard. This new Relic is like the walnuts from Last Wish, and works as a nut trace gun. 
     * Use ray to break shield and kill Taken Knight (Disciple's Hourglass). 
* You will see a Terminal Resonance debuff once you start the encounter by picking up the Resonant Shard from the terminal in the middle of the room. 
     * If this reaches zero you will die. 
     * You will need to kill the yellow bar Taken Hobgoblins to spawn Glyphkeepers. 
     * Goldbar Chieftains and Taken Boopie Bois (the Glyphkeepers) need to be killed to spawn the Disciple's Hourglass and a set of three symbols each. 
     * You will need to notate the one that matches the other set for opening the door. 
* Relic holders can see symbols on Taken Bois / non-holders see symbols on Chieftain. Killing the Disciple's Hourglass with the Resonant Shard will extend the timer by 40 seconds. 

Once you enter the correct symbol at the door you will find a small room with two dunk stations. 
* This is your first swap point. 
     * Take your time and make sure everyone is ready to go before depositing the Resonate Shard on the right. 
     * On the other side is another terminal that someone else will needto be at to retrieve the next Relic, the VOG shield. 
       * This shield Relic will clear your Darkness debuff that starts once you enter the next room. 

**Remember:** 
* As soon as the Resonate Nut is deposited the timer resets fully to 1 minute and 14 seconds. We usually deposit the Resonate Shard on the right and the VOG shield on the left for simplicity.



#### Second Room
Once BOTH Relics are picked up the door to the next area will open. Work your way through in two teams: shard going left, shield going right (to start with).

* VoG relic holder bounces between left and right sides to cleanse. 
     * Call out if you're cleansing in case someone is using a rocket launcher! 
* Best practice is that after clearing the first pair of Glyphkeepers the relic holder goes to the end where the two sides rejoin and kills adds/cleanses as fireteam members need.
* Since you have two sets of Glyphkeepers you will get two symbols
     * Enter these at the same time to open the door to the next room
* When the door opens and you enter, Screebs will spawn. It's in your best interest to clear these as soon as possible from as far away as possible.   


#### Third Room
This room introduces Taken Relic, a THIRD artifact. It will spawn in the third dunk station that the VOG Relic and Resonant Shard users are not using. This one is needed to kill the taken blights that make the enemies immune. Use the grenade button to "cleanse" the blight. You must be nearly on top of the blight when cleansing! Bear in mind that while holding this relic you WILL run slower than normal.

When swapping relics, remember to make sure everyone is ready because by depositing the Resonate Shard it resets the Terminal Resonance timer fully. When all THREE relics are picked up the door will open. 

!!!REMEMBER!!! If a player falls with a relic, the relic will respawn in the room you picked them up from. Backtrack calmly and quickly and pick it up to continue the encounter. The run CAN be salvaged as long as you remain calm and make your jumps.

VOG shield goes right, Resonant Shard goes left, one additional player goes with each to clear ads and read symbols. Blight clearer goes ping pong, follow the map. If the blight spawns on the left, the next will be on the right. Moving too quickly results in the Taken Blights respawning, so stick with the group as much as possible and don't get too far ahead.


**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** 
* Shielded Taken Knights MUST be killed by walnut beam, knocking them off the center platform is a WIPE since you cannot progress!

In this room they always appear on the platform in the middle of the room. Resonant Shard holder needs to keep an eye on the timer to reset as late as possible to maximize time. You will need to look down to the platform and shoot from top as they always spawn in the same location.

Team Left (Resonant Shard +1) kills/reads left corners of rooms and Team Right (VoG+1) the right. In this room only the 6th person is add clear/roam that can go on the opposite side of Taken blight cleanser. 

VoG CLEANSE has 3 cleansing locations. 
Entry right corner (where the Glyphkeeper spawns) cleanse right team and read then jumps across to exit left corner to cleanse left team at the bottom of the stairs. Then move to between left and right exit corners to have teams cleanse there. Exit  is at the north side of the room. Beware of the screebs here, they spawn right inside the doorway as it opens.

VoG cleanser has 3 cleansing locations. 
Entry right corner (where the Glyphkeeper spawns) cleanse the right team and read the symbols, then jumps across to exit left corner to cleanse the left team at the bottom of the stairs. Then move to between left and right exit corners to have teams cleanse there. Exit right corner you drop down into a room. 


#### Fourth Room 
This room is built around platforms. It is not bad once you get into it but take the easy jumps you know you can make in your sleep. There are two sets of symbols and Taken Knights for this room.

Again the Taken relic will cleanse back and forth and will need a second player with them to stun overloads and kill adds. The first blight will be out on a very narrow ledge, be careful. After that just go back and forth like normal.

The VOG relic holder will move to a central platform and hold position, moving up as the room is cleared for a central cleansing location. Movement of the VOG relic to either side is not needed and has been found to be much more simple if it is stationary for the cleansing. 

The Nut Gun holder will need to be mobile as the Taken Knights can be difficult to see. They will both spawn on the platforms in the middle of the room: the first on the one at the back of the right one and the second on the far middle one. Be mobile or you will not see the first spawn as there are pillars that he likes to hide behind. This player should take his defender as well as the one from the VOG shield relic to increase efficiency.

!!!REMEMBER!!! If a player falls with a relic, the relic will respawn in the room you picked them up from. Backtrack calmly and quickly and pick it up to continue the encounter. The run CAN be salvaged as long as you remain calm and make your jumps. 

Once you have killed the two Taken Knights and have the two correct symbols, open the door and deposit the relics. This will end the encounter. 
    

After the third encounter and on the way to the final boss there's a small jumping puzzle. Figure it out, we have faith in you Guardian. Small hint, kill the Glyphkeepers both left and right sides to progress and move as a team, especially at the final door.

## Fourth Encounter -- Rhulk -- Final Boss:

### Loadout
Big deeps. Bring high DPS weapons. Bring longer range add clear like AR's. High DPS supers good. Thundercrash and Tether very good. Divinity is good as well. Make sure to avoid using weapons with Ricochet Rounds for the Boss arena area. Best is to pick what the team is going to use, either RL's or different. If RL's at least one player should be running Gjallarhorn so as to buff the others. If you do not have a Gjallarhorn the team DPS falls off considerably for RL's. Sleeper is a very viable option this season as well. Aeon Swift gauntlets are a very viable option if you find yourself short on heavy ammo. You can Finish the Abomination before you dunk the Emanating Darkness debuff into the pillar easily.

### Encounter
There are two main teams for this first part of the encounter. One team will be add clearing and reading, the other will be juggling the buffs and dunking. Establish your two teams and have players designated on each team for the dunking and the calling to reduce chatter and confusion while running the encounter.
After starting the encounter by a player running forward far enough, one player will shoot and destroy the shard above the boss. After shooting this central shard two Glyphkeepers will spawn, one left and one right. Those with the debuff can see the three symbols in the air on the left and the players without the debuff can see the symbols on the right. Again, find the matching symbol between the two. The pillars will have three different symbols each, you just need to find one with the same symbol as you're looking for. IE, same symbol is Kill, just find a pillar with Kill anywhere on it and call it out for dunk

#### Debuff and Dunking Team
!!IMPORTANT!!!The player who deals the final blow to a shard gets the Leeching debuff so make sure that ONLY the player that needs the buff is the one shooting it to ensure they are the one that will receive it! 

!!!IMPORTANT!!! These buffs are on a timer, if it expires the player dies and the buff goes away. Split to extend the timer if you need to.

After receiving the first buff, this player will stand on the black plate to split the debuff. While the player with the buff is standing on the plate two more shards will show, left and right. The two other fireteam members on the Debuff and Dunk Team will shoot the two shards and gain the Leeching debuff while the original loses it. One of these players will jump into the laser beam attack to turn the debuff into Emanating Force. This player will run forward and dunk the debuff into the pillar called out by the add clear team. This player then calls out for the split for the other player that still has the Leeching buff to keep 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/main/vow-of-the-disciples-resources/destiny-2-vow-of-the-disciple-rhulk-leeching-force-cycle.png" width=250>

If the Leeching debuff is lost, either due to death or accidentally turning both into Emanating, another shard will appear above the boss's head in the center. DO NOT LOSE SECOND LEECHING, this is a wipe mechanic. 
 

#### Add Clear and Call Out Team
This team will designate one player to call out which pillar to dunk into. Be clear and concise with your call out, use RIGHT or LEFT instead of R or L unless the team allows for the shortening. If the call is incorrect or unclear and the Dunker puts it into the wrong pillar, he dies. You can burn through rezzes extremely fast in general in this fight, so take a moment and be clear on your call outs. The rest is just add clear and staying alive. We found it best to cross-shoot the adds for better angles, but do your best to keep the Dunker alive and the adds dead. That's really all there is to it!


#### Boss DPS
Once you dunk enough correct pillars (6) you move to boss DPS at the top of the long staircase in a square room. THIS BOSS CHARGES YOU. THEN KICKS YOU. REPEATEDLY. Avoid this at all costs! Blink, hunter dodge, or just getting out of the way is KEY! Remember, move to the SIDE to best avoid these attacks. A gold wave will extend out from him then the boss will charge along that path, making it easier to track him.

After the charge attack, the boss leaves behind his relic. One designated player will shoot this relic to gain the Leeching buff. We found it to be easiest to have the player dunking in the first part to do this. Where the relic was broken a symbol will appear that the player with Leeching debuff cannot see. The rest of the players will call this out with the corner of the room that the Dunker will need to go to. Again, be CLEAR and CONCISE with this call out. The Dunker will die if this call out is incorrect or not heard clearly. The player with the Leeching buff jumps into one of his beam attacks to turn Leeching into Emanating buff then deposits into the correct pillar. A weak spot appears on the boss, all players except the Dunker will shoot this until it goes immune. It almost looks like the boss is cracking where his weak point is and will be lit up. Be VERY careful that only the Dunker is the one to shoot his relic. Rinse and repeat. Be careful to not shoot the relic until the last leeching buffed player deposits. Otherwise a new symbol comes and the original symbol you called out becomes void.

Full DPS phase comes after enough dunks. This boss just goes HAM, shoot the shit out of him. Someone will try to apply Div as best they can as he bounces around the room kicking people and shooting Darkness/burning beams. Do your best to avoid him and do as much damage as possible. His crit points are the weak spots you shot earlier. If your team is not using Div or it's not applied and your team chose a precision weapon (linear fusion over RL's), aim for these points to maximize your damage. The phase ends when he goes immune and power poses. Run down to the starting area. If you dilly-dally the shield comes up and pushes you. If you're in the air you will get pushed further and have a high chance of being thrown off the map. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/main/vow-of-the-disciples-resources/Presentation1.png" width=500>

During the Final Stand mechanic you gain stacks of darkness buff quickly. Getting caught in his beam attacks you will gain stacks of darkness. Standing next to him will give stacks of darkness. Basically you need to do more damage faster than you've ever done before or you're dead and it's a wipe. While you are whittling the boss down to this phase be mindful of the line and your ammo. You very likely will be best off calling damage prior to hitting the final stand and getting more ammo and your supers back for this.


After your first successful run per week PER ACCOUNT you will have the ability to purchase ONE Resonant (red bordered) weapon for 20 spoils. You will be given the option from all the ones that you have unlocked so far. Subsequent purchases made are random rolls. Make sure to pick one up as you will need 5 to craft them. 

## Raid Loot Table

See below what loot each encounter may drop:

## Locations of Secret Rooms and Their Symbols
    
Credit goes to Skarrow9 on Reddit:
    
"Video guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayQWhcS8Zzw
This one is really fricken cool. At the beginning of the raid when you first enter the pyramid a pillar will spawn with 3 of the raid's symbols on it. You need to find the 3 secret rooms with those specific symbols in the raid!
Once you find all three, chat will say "The Disciple recognizes your offering...". Once you finish the raid an extra chest spawns that *seems* to drop a guaranteed red weapon! I don't know if this is per character, or account, or week, or whatever.

Known symbol locations -

Pyramid - Right after HUGE initial dropdown in pyramid. Make a 180, darkness crystal is to the left of the door.
 Give - Right before 1st encounter. Darkness crystal on top of door.
 Darkness - DO NOT START FIRST ENCOUNTER!! Darkness shard is by Sphinx statue on left. Opens door to the left of the statue.
 Traveler - Right as you enter the "collection" area. Jump on purple ledge and shoot darkness crystal. Opens door below.
Worship - In Caretaker final stand arena. Shard is back left and opens door 180 degrees across the path.
Stop - In second large add room or darkness shard room during the jumping puzzle (The one with the moving white pillars.) Darkness shard back right opens door next to it!
Light - Directly after second encounter. Start of jump puzzle in outside room with first darkness shard to move platforms (tons of scorn;before symbol wall). Door and shard to open on left.
Guardian - Right after 3rd encounter. Up stairs on left. Crystal is floating off of ledge and room is 180 from the direction of boss arena.
Kill - RIGHT before boss arena. Jump up multi-level platforms leading to final doors to boss. Crystal 180 degrees from direction of boss arena, in the air. Opens door on right (facing boss)."
