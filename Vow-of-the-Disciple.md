# Anomaly Clan Vow of the Disciple Walkthrough

Brought to you by bigred76, cpTylor, and Tr1d3nT. Many thanks for the review to Scorpin09 as well.


This walkthrough is meant as general advice, feel free to reach out for edits. Substitute supers/roles/weapons as you feel works best for your specific fireteam. There really is not a one size fits all for this, just use what works best for you if this isn't it. Make sure for boss DPS phases your fireteam agrees on one strategy. Having multiple strategies reduces DPS output therefore your chances for success. Be open to trying things, this is your sandbox. Get a little dirty and have some fun!

## Entrance Encounter

Loadout:
* General add clear. Whatever supers, doesn't really matter.

Encounter: 
* Kill sus Savathun, the adds will despawn
* Sparrow down the path until you reach the Bus and take a ride.
* Clear adds and the three Abominations at each stop, then pick up the gold beacons. These will give you the Knowledge buff and you can take up to three stacks. Bring them back to the Bus to deposit.
* The Abomination's existence adds to your Darkness buff and if it hits 10 you're dead, you can clear these stacks with proximity to the bus for a short period of time or killing all of the Abominations in the area. Make sure that you are cleared before running off again if the Abominations are still alive.
 
**First secret chest is in this section,** you will need to shoot three Nuts on the way. They show up on your HUD with an icon like a planetary material when you're close.The first Nut is in a small cove to the left of the boat’s second stop. It is in the corner. The second Nut is at the bus's third stop. Using the bus's stopped position as a guide, head in a 10 o’clock direction from the front of the surfboard. This Nut will be just ahead to your left. The third Nut is found under the bridge at the bus's fourth stop. You will find it hidden in the right corner and you can shoot it through the rails or from the other side one arch is missing bars where you can enter. The chest is located inside the building ahead of this on the right. Make sure to clear the adds and NOT pick up all the Wisdom buffs so the bus stays with you.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** 
* BEFORE DROPPING DOWN inside the pyramid! Check the totem in the middle of the big room. This has three symbols inside the three "secret" rooms you need to activate the wall plates in. The plate guide is at the end of this guide. You only need to activate the three shown, but if you forget what they are you CAN do all of them and still qualify for the extra chest at the final boss. To our understanding these must all be done on the same run, does not count off of a CP.
* Droping down once you're inside the pyramid is rough. Bring a sword. Hunters can dive from the top. Otherwise, you WILL break your legs (and lose a potential flawless run). Titans can use heavy on Crown, just jump out and smash away. 

## 1st Encounter: Acquisition

### Loadout
Unstoppable, add clear, burst damage heavy like Gally or sword. No preference to super, add clear and stay alive; no boss.

### Encounter

* Three sets of two teams: defender and seeker
* Arena is divided into two sides: Right side is dark, left side is light

* Three symbols on totem:
     * Top is side where taken knight spawns, kill ASAP
     * After the knight is dead the second symbol shows the room to go to. 
     * Seeker goes to room and the third (bottom) symbol spawns. Defender calls out light or dark from the bottom symbol on the totem.
     * Seeker kills Glyphkeeper (chieftain with solar shield) on the side that matches the third symbol (light/dark). Once the Glyphkeeper dies, champs will spawn near defenders. 
     * Seeker then sees a new symbol will spawn where this chieftain died. Calls out and someone in the fireteam notates the call out. 

* Each team does this, once per totem. Defender will say "Room is xxxx with xxxx side", seeker will call back "Room has XXXXX symbol"
* You are on a timer, this resets when the correct Glyphkeeper is killed inside each room.
* Once all 3 totems are done with their symbols and call outs, the obelisks near the totems will display 9 symbols each. Only one obelisk will have all three symbols. 
* Group up with two players per obelisk, look for the three symbols collected by the seekers. Once you identify the obelisk with all three, shoot the correct symbols at the same time, within about a half a second of each other. 
* If you're not fast enough, you'll see an animation on the obelisks wiping the symbols and redrawing them. Resume looking for the three symbols. You will have three chances. If you don't do it correctly by the third time, the team wipes. Each Obelisk will have all three symbols only ONCE during this encounter. After you clear a phase make sure to rule that Obelisk out and focus on the remaining ones that haven't had all three symbols yet.

Rinse and repeat three times.
