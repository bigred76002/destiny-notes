# Anomaly Clan Vow of the Disciple Walkthrough

Brought to you by bigred76, cpTylor, and Tr1d3nT. Many thanks for the review to Scorpin09 as well.


This walkthrough is meant as general advice, feel free to reach out for edits. Substitute supers/roles/weapons as you feel works best for your specific fireteam. There really is not a one size fits all for this, just use what works best for you if this isn't it. Make sure for boss DPS phases your fireteam agrees on one strategy. Having multiple strategies reduces DPS output therefore your chances for success. Be open to trying things, this is your sandbox. Get a little dirty and have some fun!

## Entrance Encounter

Loadout:
* General add clear. Whatever supers, doesn't really matter.

Encounter: 
* Kill sus Savathun, the adds will despawn
* Sparrow down the path until you reach the Bus and take a ride.
* Clear adds and the three Abominations at each stop, then pick up the gold beacons. These will give you the Knowledge buff and you can take up to three stacks. Bring them back to the Bus to deposit.
* The Abomination's existence adds to your Darkness buff and if it hits 10 you're dead, you can clear these stacks with proximity to the bus for a short period of time or killing all of the Abominations in the area. Make sure that you are cleared before running off again if the Abominations are still alive.
 
**First secret chest is in this section,** you will need to shoot three Nuts on the way. They show up on your HUD with an icon like a planetary material when you're close.The first Nut is in a small cove to the left of the boat’s second stop. It is in the corner. The second Nut is at the bus's third stop. Using the bus's stopped position as a guide, head in a 10 o’clock direction from the front of the surfboard. This Nut will be just ahead to your left. The third Nut is found under the bridge at the bus's fourth stop. You will find it hidden in the right corner and you can shoot it through the rails or from the other side one arch is missing bars where you can enter. The chest is located inside the building ahead of this on the right. Make sure to clear the adds and NOT pick up all the Wisdom buffs so the bus stays with you.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!** 
* BEFORE DROPPING DOWN inside the pyramid! Check the totem in the middle of the big room. This has three symbols inside the three "secret" rooms you need to activate the wall plates in. The plate guide is at the end of this guide. You only need to activate the three shown, but if you forget what they are you CAN do all of them and still qualify for the extra chest at the final boss. To our understanding these must all be done on the same run, does not count off of a CP.
* Droping down once you're inside the pyramid is rough. Bring a sword. Hunters can dive from the top. Otherwise, you WILL break your legs (and lose a potential flawless run). Titans can use heavy on Crown, just jump out and smash away.
