# D1 Notes on Kings Fall - Prep Guide, Team Revive Me Maybe

_by cpTylor_

In preparation for Day 1 on Aug 23rd, I put together notes regarding the Kings Fall raid as a way for me to familiarize myself with the raid as well as create something more tangible for the team to discuss as we go through the encounters and create new strategies in reaction  to our Day 1 experience. Needless to say, I couldn't be more excited about this raid, but I'm also cognizant that it'll be a new raid for me entirely. This is not intended to be a guide for the Destiny 2 version of the raid in any way. As a final note before starting, I decided not to include actual footage from the raid to avoid copyright issues -- however if anyone wants to offer some cool images, please send them our way!

If you have suggestions, comments, or critiques (and you're not from the Revive Me Maybe team), leave a comment in [Issues](https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/issues).

## Portal to Oryx's Ship

**Overall goal:** Open a portal to Oryx's ship by depositing a total of 12 take orbs on statues. No boss, mostly a "public event" type of encounter.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Two guardians stay in middle
* Two guardians go to left side of the map; two to the right. Grab an orb from each side, then dunk at the same time in the center.
* Each side requires two guardians because one of them will be carrying an orb while the other is killing enemies and breaking barriers.

**Strategy:**
* Two guardians going to right/left:
    * Look for taken orb somewhere in that arena. One person grabs an orb. Run back to middle.
    * Adds and a taken barrier will spawn. The guardian not holding the orb will escort the other guardian.
    * To take the barrier down, shoot it. If the barrier is close enough to the middle, the two guardians in the middle can help take them down.
    * Once back into the center, communicate with the guardian take picked the orb on the opposite side as yours. Dunk the orb on the statue at the same time.
* Repeat another 5 times, for a total of 12 dunks.


## Tomb Ships

**Overall goal:** Make your way across a big gap. Hive ships will be flying around and you can jump on top of them and just ride them.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Use mobility exotics like Lions and Stompees. Swords may help give that fast in-air change of direction.
* Just make your way from one end to the other. In D1, some people used to fly through it with swords.
* Once you reach another platform, there will be adds.
* Then a last ship will be waiting for the team. Someone needs to ride it across a portal, while others stand on a plate so a barrier de-activates. Once across the map, the guardian(s) who were riding the ship now stand on plates so the remaining team mates can go through.

**Final callouts:**
* This area has the first secret chest of the D1 raid. Before making across the portal, jumpon the left wall and walk it upwards for a small entrance.

## Totems

**Overall goal:** Charge a door in the center of the map, opening it. Progress is shown as symbols next to the door start glowing blue-ish. Door is charged by dunking the Deathsingers Power buff on a large central plate.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Optimize for survivability and mob-clearing weapons. There should be a few strong enemies, so a good burst-damage special weapon will probably be a good choice.
* Two groups of three guardians, one for each side of the map.
* To get the Deathsingers Power, you will need to
    * Grab an orb from the center and go to your side of the map.
    * Stand on a plate near a totem similar to the one from Pit of Heresy's Chamber of Suffering. The area near this totem has an aura that damages players over time. If noone is standing on that plate, the totem glows red and the team wipes.
    * Once you step on that plate, you should see a buff called Brand of the Unraveler. That buff gives you, and anyone near you, protection against the damage from the totem. A visible aura can be seen from other players to know when  you are near enough the player with the Brand of the Unraveler.
    * Brand of the Unraveler lasts for 30s. Once the time is up, two things happen:
      1. You love Brand of the Unraveler and **_gain the buff Deathsingers Power_**
      2. Anyone near you will get the Brand of the Unraveler and can continue to stand on the plate.
      * If nobody is near the player with the Brand of the Unraveler by the time its timer reaches zero, a new orb will appear in the center of the map, and someone will need to pick it up. This may wipe the team, as the the totam cannot be left alone.
    * Whoever gained Deathsingers Power can now run towards the center to dunk it. Whoever just gained Brand of the Unraveler can stay and babysit the totem.


**Strategy:** There is an easy rotation to keep in mind for each of the two teams of three guardians. Let's refer to players as 1, 2, and 3.
* Setup:
  * *Player 1* grabs the Aura Buff (aka `Brand of the Unraveler`) and runs towards their plate.
  * *PLayer 2* follows Player 1 to the totem, leveraging the aura from Player 1 to not die.
  * *Player 3* stays at the entrance to clear adds (witches spawn next to the door).
* After 30s:
  * *Player 1* Loses the Aura Buff and gains `Deathsingers Power x10`, leaves the plate and heads to the middle and kills adds while losing stacks of Deathsingers Power.
  * *Player 2* now gains the Aura Buff and stays on the plate.
  * *Player 3* heads down to their side and stays with Player 2 on the totem.
* Rinse and repeat...

**Final callouts:**
* This encounter will definitely have champions. I'd bet hive boomers turned into anti-barriers.
* In D1, witches had solar shields.
* In D1, if youshot an orange bar add, then it'd turn them all into ogres and kill everyone. Bug? Feature? Who knows, but it was fun (saw it on a couple of vids, including Sweaticle's).

## Warpriest

**Overall goal:** Kill the Warpriest within four damage phases. To remove immunity, one player will need to hold the Brand of the Initiate buff, and provide team mates the Aura of the Initiate buff. After each damage phase, the Warpriest will try to wipe the team, and players can hide to avoid wipe. This wipe mechanic is unavoudable on the fourth damage phase.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* High DPS weapons. Adds get progressively more aggressive as the encounter continues. Gjally/linears may be a good option here.
* Enemies will start spawning with the boss immune in the center. After three knights are taken down (1 left, 1 right, 1 center), players will see `Glyph Sequence started` on their screen. This triggers a mini-puzzle to remove immunity from the boss: Players will need to step on plates following a very specific order.
* To understand the puzzle, see this high def render of the encounter available below:

<img src="https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/raw/main/kings-fall-reprise/warpriest-schematics.png" width="500">

* Puzzle:
  * One player will be positioned on the same platform as the warpriest. This player is represented above as "Crystal Observer." This player should pay attention to the three rocks, represented by green squares with blue facing the Crystal Observer.
  * Everyone else near each of the plates but :warning: without stepping on them right away :warning:. The plates, represented above by green circles, will be located behind rocks that offer protection from the boss.
  * The Crystal Observer will see one of the rocks start to glow blue (exactly where the diagram above shows the blue square). The Crystal Observer will then call out tot he team which of the crystals is glowing, and at least one player will step *only on that plate*. Players should not step on any other plates, otherwise the puzzle fails (a message saying `Glyph released - sequence broken` will appear in such case).
  * This will happen three times in total, until all three crystals glow and the last plate has been stepped on.
  * The player who steps on the last plate receives the `Brand of the Initiate x5` buff.

* Once a player has the 5 stacks of Brand of the Initiate, DPS starts. Here's the mechanics:
  * This buff has a 10s timer. If the timer reaches zero, the player holding this buff dies and the buff is transmitted to someone else. We don't want that.
  * To reset the timer, the player with Brand of the Initiate will need to kill an enemy. There will be lots of them, but they may hide.
  * Whenever the timer is reset, one stack of the Brand of the Initiate buff will be removed, meaning that the team will have at max `5 x 10s = 50s` of DPS.
  * Every one else will see an aura near the player with the Brand of the Initiate. Once you're inside of that aura, you should see a buff called `Aura of the Initiate`. With that buff, you can damage the boss.
* Once DPS has ended, if the boss didn't die, the Warpriest will initiate a wipe mechanic. The whole room will glow white, and only way not to die is to hide before the pillars.
  * Make sure you're within the shade created by the pillar.
  * When the wipe mechanic is done, **the pillar will will be destroyed.** That means that the team will not be able to hide there anymore.
  * After 3 damage phases, there will not be any pillars to hide, so the fourth damage phase is the last chance to kill the boss.

**Strategy:**
* Roles:
  * Pick one player as the holder of the Brand of the Initiate. Make sure to have single target damage weapon for adds. DO NOT USE AOE WEAPONS, you want to pace killing adds as much as possible. Mobility is desirable.
  * Pick one player as Crystal Observer. Good resilience to tank a few shots from the boss as you're looking at Crystals.
* Start by spreading across the map and kill adds.
* Once `Glyph sequence started` is seen on the screen, the Crystal Observed goes to its position as shown in the map above.
* Anyone, EXCEPT for the player who will hold Brand of the Initiate, will step on the plate that the Crystal Observer calls out for the 1st and 2nd times.
* The remaining plate should be stepped on by the player assigned to hold of the Brand of the Initiate only - and only after the Crystal Observer calls out to avoid stepping onto that plate too early.
* That initiates DPS:
  * Everyone goes near the player holding Brand of the Initiate, and make sure to receive Aura of the Initiate. Start DPS.
  * The player holding Brand of the Initiate will, however, focus on the timer and killing adds once the timer is low enough. Many guides mention adds may try and hide, so it may be a good idea to not distract yourself with DPS during this phase, otherwise deaths may snowball the team into a wipe.
  * Once the last stack of Brand of the Initiate is removed, everyone hides behind the pillar.
  * Wait for the wipe mechanic.
* Rinse and repeat exactly the same thing.

## Golgoroth's Cellar

**Overall goal:** Make it alive. See map below. Potentially look for a secret chest (go through plates in the right order).
