# D1 Notes on Kings Fall - Prep Guide, Team Revive Me Maybe

_by cpTylor_

In preparation for Day 1 on Aug 23rd, I put together notes regarding the Kings Fall raid as a way for me to familiarize myself with the raid as well as create something more tangible for the team to discuss as we go through the encounters and create new strategies in reaction  to our Day 1 experience. Needless to say, I couldn't be more excited about this raid, but I'm also cognizant that it'll be a new raid for me entirely. This is not intended to be a guide for the Destiny 2 version of the raid in any way. As a final note before starting, I decided not to include actual footage from the raid to avoid copyright issues -- however if anyone wants to offer some cool images, please send them our way!

If you have suggestions, comments, or critiques (and you're not from the Revive Me Maybe team), leave a comment in [Issues](https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/issues).

## Portal to Oryx's Ship

**Overall goal:** Open a portal to Oryx's ship by depositing a total of 12 take orbs on statues. No boss, mostly a "public event" type of encounter.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Two guardians stay in middle
* Two guardians go to left side of the map; two to the right. Grab an orb from each side, then dunk at the same time in the center.
* Each side requires two guardians because one of them will be carrying an orb while the other is killing enemies and breaking barriers.

**Strategy:**
* Two guardians going to right/left:
    * Look for taken orb somewhere in that arena. One person grabs an orb. Run back to middle.
    * Adds and a taken barrier will spawn. The guardian not holding the orb will escort the other guardian.
    * To take the barrier down, shoot it. If the barrier is close enough to the middle, the two guardians in the middle can help take them down.
    * Once back into the center, communicate with the guardian take picked the orb on the opposite side as yours. Dunk the orb on the statue at the same time.
* Repeat another 5 times, for a total of 12 dunks.


## Tomb Ships

**Overall goal:** Make your way across a big gap. Hive ships will be flying around and you can jump on top of them and just ride them.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Use mobility exotics like Lions and Stompees. Swords may help give that fast in-air change of direction.
* Just make your way from one end to the other. In D1, some people used to fly through it with swords.
* Once you reach another platform, there will be adds.
* Then a last ship will be waiting for the team. Someone needs to ride it across a portal, while others stand on a plate so a barrier de-activates. Once across the map, the guardian(s) who were riding the ship now stand on plates so the remaining team mates can go through.

To facilitate, here's a video demonstrating it by Eso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN34G8JauMo

**Final callouts:**
* This area has the first secret chest of the D1 raid. Before making across the portal, jumpon the left wall and walk it upwards for a small entrance.

## Totems

**Overall goal:** Charge a door in the center of the map, opening it. Progress is shown as symbols next to the door start glowing blue-ish. Door is charged by dunking the Deathsingers Power buff on a large central plate.

<img src="https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/raw/main/kings-fall-reprise/totems.png" width="750">

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Optimize for survivability and mob-clearing weapons. There should be a few strong enemies, so a good burst-damage special weapon will probably be a good choice.
* Two groups of three guardians, one for each side of the map.
* To get the Deathsingers Power, you will need to
    * Grab an orb from the center and go to your side of the map.
    * Stand on a plate near a totem similar to the one from Pit of Heresy's Chamber of Suffering. The area near this totem has an aura that damages players over time. If noone is standing on that plate, the totem glows red and the team wipes.
    * Once you step on that plate, you should see a buff called Brand of the Unraveler. That buff gives you, and anyone near you, protection against the damage from the totem. A visible aura can be seen from other players to know when  you are near enough the player with the Brand of the Unraveler.
    * Brand of the Unraveler lasts for 30s. Once the time is up, two things happen:
      1. You love Brand of the Unraveler and **_gain the buff Deathsingers Power_**
      2. Anyone near you will get the Brand of the Unraveler and can continue to stand on the plate.
      * If nobody is near the player with the Brand of the Unraveler by the time its timer reaches zero, a new orb will appear in the center of the map, and someone will need to pick it up. This may wipe the team, as the the totam cannot be left alone.
    * Whoever gained Deathsingers Power can now run towards the center to dunk it. Whoever just gained Brand of the Unraveler can stay and babysit the totem.


**Strategy:** There is an easy rotation to keep in mind for each of the two teams of three guardians. Let's refer to players as 1, 2, and 3.
* Setup:
  * *Player 1* grabs the Aura Buff (aka `Brand of the Unraveler`) and runs towards their plate.
  * *PLayer 2* follows Player 1 to the totem, leveraging the aura from Player 1 to not die.
  * *Player 3* stays at the entrance to clear adds (witches spawn next to the door).
* After 30s:
  * *Player 1* Loses the Aura Buff and gains `Deathsingers Power x10`, leaves the plate and heads to the middle and kills adds while losing stacks of Deathsingers Power.
  * *Player 2* now gains the Aura Buff and stays on the plate.
  * *Player 3* heads down to their side and stays with Player 2 on the totem.
* Rinse and repeat...

**Final callouts:**
* This encounter will definitely have champions. I'd bet hive boomers turned into anti-barriers.
* In D1, witches had solar shields.
* In D1, if youshot an orange bar add, then it'd turn them all into ogres and kill everyone. Bug? Feature? Who knows, but it was fun (saw it on a couple of vids, including Sweaticle's).

## Warpriest

**Overall goal:** Kill the Warpriest within four damage phases. To remove immunity, one player will need to hold the Brand of the Initiate buff, and provide team mates the Aura of the Initiate buff. After each damage phase, the Warpriest will try to wipe the team, and players can hide to avoid wipe. This wipe mechanic is unavoudable on the fourth damage phase.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* High DPS weapons. Adds get progressively more aggressive as the encounter continues. Gjally/linears may be a good option here. Well/bubbles seemed to be common choices for suppers to help with damage buffs.
* Enemies will start spawning with the boss immune in the center. After three knights are taken down (1 left, 1 right, 1 center), players will see `Glyph Sequence started` on their screen. This triggers a mini-puzzle to remove immunity from the boss: Players will need to step on plates following a very specific order.
* To understand the puzzle, see this high def render of the encounter available below:

<img src="https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/raw/main/kings-fall-reprise/warpriest-schematics.png" width="500">

* Puzzle:
  * One player will be positioned on the same platform as the warpriest. This player is represented above as "Crystal Observer." This player should pay attention to the three rocks, represented by green squares with blue facing the Crystal Observer.
  * Everyone else near each of the plates but :warning: without stepping on them right away :warning:. The plates, represented above by green circles, will be located behind rocks that offer protection from the boss.
  * The Crystal Observer will see one of the rocks start to glow blue (exactly where the diagram above shows the blue square). The Crystal Observer will then call out tot he team which of the crystals is glowing, and at least one player will step *only on that plate*. Players should not step on any other plates, otherwise the puzzle fails (a message saying `Glyph released - sequence broken` will appear in such case).
  * This will happen three times in total, until all three crystals glow and the last plate has been stepped on.
  * The player who steps on the last plate receives the `Brand of the Initiate x5` buff.

* Once a player has the 5 stacks of Brand of the Initiate, DPS starts. Here's the mechanics:
  * This buff has a 10s timer. If the timer reaches zero, the player holding this buff dies and the buff is transmitted to someone else. We don't want that.
  * To reset the timer, the player with Brand of the Initiate will need to kill an enemy. There will be lots of them, but they may hide.
  * Whenever the timer is reset, one stack of the Brand of the Initiate buff will be removed, meaning that the team will have at max `5 x 10s = 50s` of DPS.
  * Every one else will see an aura near the player with the Brand of the Initiate. Once you're inside of that aura, you should see a buff called `Aura of the Initiate`. With that buff, you can damage the boss.
* Once DPS has ended, if the boss didn't die, the Warpriest will initiate a wipe mechanic. The whole room will glow white, and only way not to die is to hide before the pillars.
  * Make sure you're within the shade created by the pillar.
  * When the wipe mechanic is done, **the pillar will will be destroyed.** That means that the team will not be able to hide there anymore.
  * After 3 damage phases, there will not be any pillars to hide, so the fourth damage phase is the last chance to kill the boss.

**Strategy:**
* Roles:
  * Pick one player as the holder of the Brand of the Initiate. Make sure to have single target damage weapon for adds. DO NOT USE AOE WEAPONS, you want to pace killing adds as much as possible. Mobility is desirable.
  * Pick one player as Crystal Observer. Good resilience to tank a few shots from the boss as you're looking at Crystals.
* Start by spreading across the map and kill adds.
* Once `Glyph sequence started` is seen on the screen, the Crystal Observed goes to its position as shown in the map above.
* Anyone, EXCEPT for the player who will hold Brand of the Initiate, will step on the plate that the Crystal Observer calls out for the 1st and 2nd times.
* The remaining plate should be stepped on by the player assigned to hold of the Brand of the Initiate only - and only after the Crystal Observer calls out to avoid stepping onto that plate too early.
* That initiates DPS:
  * Everyone goes near the player holding Brand of the Initiate, and make sure to receive Aura of the Initiate. Start DPS.
  * The player holding Brand of the Initiate will, however, focus on the timer and killing adds once the timer is low enough. Many guides mention adds may try and hide, so it may be a good idea to not distract yourself with DPS during this phase, otherwise deaths may snowball the team into a wipe.
  * Once the last stack of Brand of the Initiate is removed, everyone hides behind the pillar.
  * Wait for the wipe mechanic.
* Rinse and repeat exactly the same thing.

## Golgoroth's Cellar

**Overall goal:** Make it alive. See map below. Potentially look for a secret chest (go through plates in the right order).

Figure above provided by u/Taux on this [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3lzji8/spoiler_hd_golgoroths_cellar_map/). Huge shoutout to Taux!

## Golgoroth

**Overall goal:** Have someone get Golgoroth's attention, while others DPS him. To effectively DPS Golgoroth, you need to stand on a pool generated by a bubble dropped from the ceiling. This is done in intervals of 20s.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* High DPS weapons and supers are preferred, some option to quickly clean small and medium adds.
* To get Golgoroth's Gaze:
  * One player will get it by shooting the Ogre's crit spot on its neck/head. You'll get a buff `Golgoroth's Gaze` with a 20s timer.
  * During this time, Golgoroth's stomach will be exposed. and open for damage.
  * All of Golgoroth's attention will then be on this player. They will shoot taken blights which can be shot down with an smg/lmg/etc.
  * If another player shoots Golgoroth's crit BEFORE the timer is out, that player will steal the `Golgoroth's Gaze` buff with a reset timer. This allows the damage to be extended for additional 20s.
* Once the stomach's open:
  * Anyone can shoot it for damage, however the damage will be minimal.
  * To effectively damage this boss, one bubble from the ceiling needs to be shot (about 5 scout rifle shots) so it drops and creates a pool on the lower level, next to Golgoroth (looks like a witherhoard pool). Any player standing on that pool can damage Golgoroth more effectively.
  * The player holding Golgoroth's Gaze needs to stand in line with where the pool was formed and on top of the standing platform; otherwise, other players won't be able to shoot Golgoroth's stomach. If the gaze holder is on the same level as other players, Golgoroth will be shooting the whole team.
  * After some time (unclear how long), that pool disappears.
  * Be aware of cursed thralls spawning on the lower level during damage.


**Safer strategy:**
* Five players set to handle adds + high DPS.
  * One of the five is designated to shoot down the bubbles from the ceiling.
* One player is designated to hold Golgoroth's Gaze, giving preference for survivibility and shooting down taken blights.
* Everyone kills adds until the wave ends.
* Gaze holder and the bubble shooter coordinate so that the bubble is shot out of the ceiling about the same time as the gaze is acquired. This maximizes the DPS time.
* The DPS team (of 5 guardians) unleashes as much damage as possible in that time frame. The gaze holder stays alive and shoots down blights.
* Once 20s is over, work on another wave of adds. Rinse and repeat.

**Aggressive strategy:**
* Four players set to handle adds + high DPS. One of them is designated to shoot down the bubble.
* Two players designated as gaze holders, but this time also carrying DPS weapons. Lets call them Gaze Holder 1 & 2.
* Once the first wave of adds is down, then...
  1. Gaze Holder 1 and the bubble shooter coordinate to start DPS.
  1. Gaze Holder 1 survives, others DPS.
  1. Gaze Holder 1 calls out when their timer is about to end, Gaze Holder 2 steals the gaze from 1.
  1. Bubble shooter shoots down bubbles as needed.
  1. Rinse and repeat.
* The downside of this strate is that the team will need to handle adds during DPS.

## Jumping puzzle

**Overall goal:** Make your way through platforms, being careful not to be yeeted by horizontal pillars that come out of the wall.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* No much to say. Optimize for movement.
* Half-way through, you'll need to pull your ghost to see hidden platforms to jump into.
* At the end, there will be three plates. Guardians need to stand on them to allow others to continue forward.
* People used to cheese this by using sword light attack against the inclined wall.

## Daughters of Oryx

**Overall goal:** Two bosses that need to be taken down close together, with precision damage multiplier. To damage either of the bosses, a randomly selecteed player need to grab an orb and dunk on the respective boss. Survivability is key in this encounter tho.

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
* Encounter starts with the two daughters in the center, one each side. One at a time will sing, and visually will grow red. Keep that in mind. See map below.
* One player will randomly gain the `Torn Between Dimensions` buff, and will look like it's being "taken" - Let's call this player the "Taken Player." That player will be the only one who can climb a set of platforms and grab the orb necessary to trigger DPS.
* Once a player gets `Torn Between Dimensions`:
  * The Taken Player will need to look up and see where the orb is. It will be immediately above one of the four plates (see map below).
  * The Taken Player will then **move towards the first plate counter-clockwise from the plate with the objective above it**.
  * Four other players will now need to step on one plate at a time, following a counter-clockwise sequence. If the sequence is incorrect, the Taken Player will not be able to continue climb. See map below for an example where the taken orb appears on the top right plate.
  * Once the Taken Player has reached the orb, they will be able to grab it to gain the `Brand Claimer` buff. This can be dunked by interacting with one of the Daughters of Oryx. This triggers DPS on the Daughter of Oryx in which the buff was dunked.
  * If one of the Daughter of Oryx is killed, then the other **must be killed on the next damage phase.** Otherwise, this is a team wipe.
* While the team is going after the taken orb, there will be a timer on everyone's screen. Dunking the orb needs to be done before that timer ends.
* I do not understand the wiping mechanic related to the aura as of yet surrounding the Taken Player, so leaving this comment for now.

<img src="https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/raw/main/kings-fall-reprise/daughters.png" width="700">

**Strategy (fixed player rotation, moving pillars):**
* Team designation:
  * Decide where DPS will be done from (e.g. next to where the Daughters of Oryx stand).
  * Designate Players 1-4. They will stand on plates in that order, always.
  * Designate the Sub Player. If the taken player happens to be one of the Players 1-4, then the Sub Player will sub for the Taken Player and step on the respective order. For instance, if Player 3 is the Taken player, then the Sub Player will step on the third plate.
* Wait until a player gets `Torn Between Dimensions`. That player is the Taken Player for that round.
* Taken player calls out the location of the orb, and directs themselves to the first pillar (i.e. the first one counter-clockwise after the pillar with the take orb above it).
* One other player follows the Taken Player and stands on the first plate.
* In order, another three players stand on the plates following a counter-clockwise order.
* Taken player grabs the orb and lets everyone know he's now moving down for DPS.
* Everyone **gathers together on the opposite side from the daughter that is not singing.** Taken player deposits the taken orb on the Daughter that is not singing.
  * This will make it easier to damage that Daughter of Oryx since it will be standing still instead of moving its head (crit spot).
* Everyone DPSs the that Daughter of Oryx.
* Repeat, however....
  * **If the Daughter of Oryx did not die, do not repeat DPS on the same Daughter.** Alternate the Daughter of Oryx receiving damage and make sure you can kill both in back-to-back damage phase. Otherwise, the team wipes.
  * As far as I could understand, there is no limit to the number of damage phases, so the wipe mechanic is related to killing both back to back, rather than a predetermined set number of damage phases.

## Oryx, the Taken Kings

**Overall goal:** Defeat Oryx by slowly damaging the boss and staying alive. Interestingly, you don't DPS Oryx (as in, it's not about lots of damage per second). This will be done via a very similar mechanic as in the [Daughters of Oryx](https://github.com/bigred76002/destiny-notes/blob/main/kings-fall-reprise/Kings-Fall-Reprise-Pre-Day1-Research.md#daughters-of-oryx).

**General Setup and Mechanics:**
