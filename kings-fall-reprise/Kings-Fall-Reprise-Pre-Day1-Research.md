# D1 Notes on Kings Fall
## Revive Me Maybe - Prep Guide

_by cpTylor_

In preparation for Day 1 on Aug 23rd, I put together notes regarding the Kings Fall raid as a way for me to familiarize myself with the raid as well as create something more tangible for the team to discuss as we go through the encounters and create new strategies in reaction  to our Day 1 experience. Needless to say, I couldn't be more excited about this raid, but I'm also cognizant that it'll be a new raid for me entirely. This is not intended to be a guide for the Destiny 2 version of the raid in any way. As a final note before starting, I decided not to include actual footage from the raid to avoid copyright issues -- however if anyone wants to offer some cool images, please send them our way!

If you have suggestions, comments, or critiques (and you're not from the Revive Me Maybe team), leave a comment in [Issues](https://github.com/cptylor/destiny-notes/issues).

## Portal to Oryx's Ship

**Overall goal:** Open a portal to Oryx's ship by depositing a total of 12 take orbs on statues. No boss, mostly a "public event" type of encounter.

**General setup:**
* Two guardians stay in middle
* Two guardians go to left side of the map; two to the right.

**Strategy:**
* Two guardians going to right/left:
    * Look for taken orb somewhere in that arena. One person grabs an orb. Run back to middle.
    * Adds and a taken barrier will spawn. The guardian not holding the orb will escort the other guardian.
    * To take the barrier down, shoot it. If the barrier is close enough to the middle, the two guardians in the middle can help take them down.
    * Once back into the center, communicate with the guardian take picked the orb on the opposite side as yours. Dunk the orb on the statue at the same time.
* Repeat another 5 times, for a total of 12 dunks.


## Tomb Ships

**Overall goal:** Make your way across a big gap. Hive ships will be flying around and you can jump on top of them and just ride them.

**General setup:**
* Use mobility exotics like Lions and Stompees. Swords may help give that fast in-air change of direction.

**Mechanics:**
* Just make your way from one end to the other. In D1, some people used to fly through it with swords.
* Once you reach another platform, there will be adds.
* Then a last ship will be waiting for the team. Someone needs to ride it across a portal, while others stand on a plate so a barrier de-activates. Once across the map, the guardian(s) who were riding the ship now stand on plates so the remaining team mates can go through.

**Final callouts:**
* This area has the first secret chest of the D1 raid. Before making across the portal, jumpon the left wall and walk it upwards for a small entrance.

## Totems

**Overall goal:** Charge a door in the center of the map, opening it. Progress is shown as symbols next to the door start glowing blue-ish. Door is charged by dunking the Deathsingers Power buff on a large central plate.

**General setup:**
* Optimize for survivability and mob-clearing weapons. There should be a few strong enemies, so a good burst-damage special weapon will probably be a good choice.
* Two groups of three guardians, one for each side of the map.
* To get the Deathsingers Power, you will need to
    * Grab an orb from the center and go to your side of the map.
    * Stand on a plate near a totem similar to the one from Pit of Heresy's Chamber of Suffering. The area near this totem has an aura that damages players over time. If noone is standing on that plate, the totem glows red and the team wipes.
    * Once you step on that plate, you should see a buff called Brand of the Unraveler. That buff gives you, and anyone near you, protection against the damage from the totem. A visible aura can be seen from other players to know when  you are near enough the player with the Brand of the Unraveler.
    * Brand of the Unraveler lasts for 30s. Once the time is up, two things happen:
      1. You love Brand of the Unraveler and **_gain the buff Deathsingers Power_**
      2. Anyone near you will get the Brand of the Unraveler and can continue to stand on the plate.
      * If nobody is near the player with the Brand of the Unraveler by the time its timer reaches zero, a new orb will appear in the center of the map, and someone will need to pick it up. This may wipe the team, as the the totam cannot be left alone.
    * Whoever gained Deathsingers Power can now run towards the center to dunk it. Whoever just gained Brand of the Unraveler can stay and babysit the totem.


**Strategy:** There is an easy rotation to keep in mind for each of the two teams of three guardians. Let's refer to players as 1, 2, and 3.
* Setup:
  * *Player 1* grabs the Aura Buff (aka `Brand of the Unraveler`) and runs towards their plate.
  * *PLayer 2* follows Player 1 to the totem, leveraging the aura from Player 1 to not die.
  * *Player 3* stays at the entrance to clear adds (witches spawn next to the door).
* After 30s:
  * *Player 1* Loses the Aura Buff and gains `Deathsingers Power x10`, leaves the plate and heads to the middle and kills adds while losing stacks of Deathsingers Power.
  * *Player 2* now gains the Aura Buff and stays on the plate.
  * *Player 3* heads down to their side and stays with Player 2 on the totem.
* Rinse and repeat...

**Final callouts:**
* This encounter will definitely have champions. I'd bet hive boomers turned into anti-barriers.
* In D1, witches had solar shields.
* In D1, if youshot an orange bar add, then it'd turn them all into ogres and kill everyone. Bug? Feature? Who knows, but it was fun (saw it on a couple of vids, including Sweaticle's).

## Warpriest

**Overall goal:** Kill the Warpriest within four damage phases.

**General setup:**
